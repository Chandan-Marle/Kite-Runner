                Repentance can manifest itself to affect people's lives in many ways: <br>
                "I could almost feel the emptiness in Soraya's womb, like it was a living, <br>
                breathing thing." (Hosseini 189). Through what seems to be divine intervention, <br>
                Amir's guilt manifests itself as an inability to have a child. Amir hasn't <br>
                redeemed himself for his cowardice, and thus isn't able to produce offspring. <br>

                <br>
                "Then late that fall, Farzana gave birth to a stillborn baby girl." (Hosseini 209). <br>
                Hassan's repentance comes in the form of his first stillborn child. Repentence not <br>
                for his sins (he seemingly dosen't have any), but the sin of his father being not Ali, <br>
                but Baba. He also must repent for the many sins of his mother. <br>
