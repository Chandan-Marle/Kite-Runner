                Some of the more prominent examples: <br>
                "There is a way to be good again" (Hosseini 2). <br>
                A line repeated many times, and for good reason. Amir realizes <br>
                that there is a way to find the redemption he so desperately wants. <br>
                Redemption in the form of helping a particular child. <br>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <br>
                "A way to end the cycle. With a little boy. An orphan. <br>
                Hassan's son. Somewhere in Kabul." (Hosseini 227). The redemption <br>
                comes to him in the form of Hassan's child. Through Sohrab, Amir is <br>
                able to do wat he couldn't back in the alley and be brave. <br>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <br>
                "I looked down at Sohrab. One corner of his mouth had curled up <br>
                just so. A smile." (Hosseini 370). After bringing Sorhab back from <br>
                Afganistan, Amir feels almost redeemed, but not quite. In helping <br>
                Sohrab be happy again, Amir completes the task given to him to <br>
                Rahim Kahn, to be good again. <br>
