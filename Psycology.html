                        Psycology is important in understanding people and the means in which they interact: <br>
                        "After the initial shock of the transition to parenthood, parents expressed feeling special <br>
                        and reported increased self-esteem." (Nomaguchi np). Through being able to raise and nurture <br>
                        Sohrab, Amir becomes more comfident in himself and has a higher self-esteem. This boost in self <br>
                        esteem also makes Amir feel more or less absolved of sin. <br>

                        "In [a] study that focused on women with professional careers, mothers expressed that <br>
                        they 'fell in love' with their children." (Nomaguchi np). Amir begins to feel the same <br>
                        unconditional for Sorhab as he would his own child immediately after leaving Afganistan. <br>
                        He does, in fact, "fall in love" with Sohrab, and starts to focus intensly on his needs. <br>
