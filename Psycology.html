                    "After the initial shock of the transition to parenthood, parents expressed feeling special <br>
                    and reported increased self-esteem" (Nomaguchi np). Through being able to raise and nurture <br>
                    Sohrab, Amir becomes more comfident in himself and has a higher self-esteem. This boost in self <br>
                    esteem also makes Amir feel more or less absolved of sin. <br>

                    they 'fell in love' with their children" (Nomaguchi np). Amir begins to feel the same <br>
                    unconditional for Sorhab as he would his own child immediately after leaving Afganistan. <br>
                    He does, in fact, "fall in love" with Sohrab, and starts to focus intensly on his needs. <br>
