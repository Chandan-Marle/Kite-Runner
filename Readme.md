(1st redemption)"There is a way to be good again" (Hosseini 2). a line repeated many times, and for good reason. Amir realizes that there is a way to find the redemption he so desperately wants. Redemption in the form of helping a particular child. 

(1st repentance) "I could almost feel the emptiness in Soraya's womb, like it was a living, breathing thing." (Hosseini 189). Through what seems to be divine intervention, Amir's guilt manifests itself as an inability to have a child. Amir hasn't redeemed himself for his cowardice, and thus isn't able to produce offspring. 

(2nd redemption) "A way to end the cycle. With a little boy. An orphan. Hassan's son. Somewhere in Kabul." (Hosseini 227). The redemption comes to him in the form of Hassan's child. Through Sohrab, Amir is able to do wat he couldn't back in the alley and be brave. 

(2nd repentence) "Then late that fall, Farzana gave birth to a stillborn baby girl." (Hosseini 209). Hassan's repentance comes in the form of his first stillborn child. Repentence not for his sins (he seemingly dosen't have any), but the sin of his father being not Ali, but Baba. He also must repent for the many sins of his mother. 

(3rd redemption)"I looked down at Sohrab. One corner of his mouth had curled up just so. A smile." (Hosseini 370). After bringing Sorhab back from Afganistan, Amir feels almost redeemed, but not quite. In helping Sohrab be happy again, Amir completes the task given to him to Rahim Kahn, to be good again. 

(psychology) "After the initial shock of the transition to parenthood, parents expressed feeling special and reported increased self-esteem." (Nomaguchi np). Through being able to raise and nurture Sohrab, Amir becomes more comfident in himself and has a higher self-esteem. This boost in self esteem also makes Amir feel more or less absolved of sin.

(psychology) "In [a] study that focused on women with professional careers, mothers expressed that they 'fell in love' with their children." (Nomaguchi np). Amir begins to feel the same unconditional for Sorhab as he would his own child immediately after leaving Afganistan. He does, in fact, "fall in love" with Sohrab, and starts to focus intensly on his needs.
